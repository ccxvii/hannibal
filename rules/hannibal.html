<h3 id="2.2">2.2. The Playing Pieces</h3>
<p>COMBAT UNITS: Each round playing piece that has a picture of a Roman or Carthaginian printed on it represents a number of Combat Units of that nationality equal to its printed value. Combat Unit pieces of value 1 can be used to make change for Combat Unit pieces of value 2, 3 and 5 (and vice-versa) at any point during play. The number supplied with the game is not an intentional limit (except the siege train and the elephants), players may create more if needed.
<p>GENERALS: Each rectangular playing piece represents a single General. Place Generals upright in plastic stands.
<p>POLITICAL CONTROL MARKERS: The small circular playing pieces, having a Roman and Carthaginian symbol printed back and front, are used to record which side has Political Control of a space. Throughout the rest of these rules, the term Political Control Marker will be abbreviated as PC marker. The square playing pieces are Walled Cities and the hexagonal pieces are Tribes. These two types of pieces act like PC markers in all respects except they are more difficult to convert or remove <a href="#20">[20]</a>.

<h2 id="3">3. GLOSSARY OF GAME TERMS</h2>
<p>The following are important game terms and abbreviations you should be familiar with before reading the rules:
<dl>
<p>Africa: All spaces in the four Provinces of Western Numidia, Eastern Numidia, Carthaginia and Carthage.
<p>Army: An Army consists of a general and any number of friendly combat units stacked together in a space.
<p>CU: An abbreviation for combat unit
<p>Consul: A Roman general is either called a consul or a proconsul. Consuls outrank proconsuls. <a href="#18">[18]</a>.
<p>Consular Army: An army commanded by a consul <a href="#18.1">[18.1]</a>.
<p>Holding Box: The square boxes on the map above each general&apos;s Special Ability.
<p>Italy: All spaces in Gallia Cisalpinia, Etruria, Apulia, Latium, Campania, Lucania, and Samnium.
<p>Operation Number: The number between 1 and 3 on the upper-left-hand corner of each strategy card.
<p>Political Control (PC): A player controls a space if he has a PC marker in it. A player controls a Province if he controls the majority of the spaces in the Province. A space containing a PC marker remains under the control of the owning player even if an enemy General and/or CUs are also present.
<p>Province: A group of spaces located within a Province boundary line. There are 21 provinces in the game, but only 18 of them count for victory purposes <a href="#19.1">[19.1]</a>.
<p>Spain (Hispania): All spaces in the four Provinces of Baetica, Celtiberia, Orospeda, and Idubeda.
</dl>

<h2 class="pb" id="4">4. SETTING UP THE GAME</h2>
<p>Place the turn marker in the turn 1space (218 B.C.) on the Turn Record Track, and set up the playing pieces as indicated below.

<h3 id="4.1">4.1. Roman Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>8 CUs and the consul Publius Cornelius Scipio in Rome (Latium).
<li>8 CUs and the consul Tiberius Longus in Agrigentum (Sicilia).
<li>Place Roman PC markers in each space on the map colored black. Place round PC markers in the round spaces and place Walled City Markers in the square spaces that match their name.
<li>The seven other Roman generals are set aside, they will enter play later in the game as reinforcements. Place the eight round Roman general markers in a cup for random draw.
</ul>

<h3 id="4.2">4.2. Carthaginian Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li>4 CUs and Hanno in Carthage.
<li>10 CUs (two of which are CUs with Elephants) and Hannibal in Saguntum. Place Mago and H. Gisgo in Hannibal&apos;s Holding Box.
<li>2 CUs and Hasdrubal in New Carthage.
<li>Place Carthaginian PC markers in each space on the map colored blue. Place round PC markers in the round spaces and place Walled City Markers in the square spaces that match their name.
</ul>

<h3 id="4.3">4.3. Tribe Setup</h3>
<p>Place the eight hexagonal Tribe Markers in the hexagonal spaces that match their tribe name.

<h3 id="4.4">4.4. Event &amp; Battle Decks</h3>
<p>Separately shuffle the deck of 48 Battle Cards and the deck of 64 Strategy Cards and place the two decks off to the side. You are now ready to play.

<h2 class="pb" id="5">5. SEQUENCE OF PLAY</h2>
<p><i>Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage</i> is played in turns, each of which must be played in the following order:
<ol>
<li>Reinforcement Phase (Skip this phase on Turn 1).
<ol class="alpha">
<li>The Carthaginian player places his reinforcements <a href="#6.1">[6.1]</a>.
<li>If the Carthaginian player has any displaced generals <a href="#10.10">[10.10]</a>, he may return them all to the map, placing them with any Carthaginian CUs.
<li>The Roman player places his Reinforcements <a href="#6.2">[6.2]</a>. If this is turn six, he receives Scipio Africanus plus five additional CUs.
<li>The Roman player designates a Proconsul, removes his old Consuls, and randomly selects and places two new
Consuls <a href="#6.4">[6.4]</a>.
</ol>
<li>Deal Strategy Cards
<p>Each player is dealt Strategy Cards. The number of strategy cards dealt to each player is listed on the Turn Record Track.
<li>Strategy Phase
<p>The players resolve this phase by playing their strategy cards one at a time, alternating back and forth between them (i.e., one player plays a card, then his opponent plays one). The Strategy Phase ends when both players have exhausted their hand.
<li>Winter Attrition Phase
<p>Both players conduct Winter Attrition against their CUs <a href="#21.1">[21.1]</a>.
<li>Political Isolation Removal Phase
<p>Both players (first the Roman followed by the Carthaginian) remove all their non-walled, non-tribal PC markers which are Isolated <a href="#19.4">[19.4]</a>.
<li>Victory Check
<p>Both players calculate their Political Points as explained in <a href="#22.1">[22.1]</a>. If one player has less Political Points than the other player, he will lose a number of PC markers as explained in <a href="#22.2">[22.2]</a>.
<li>End of Turn
<p>After completing the Victory Check, begin another game turn. Play continues until one side wins a Sudden Death Victory <a href="#23">[23]</a> or all turns have been played.
</ol>

<h2 id="6">6. REINFORCEMENTS</h2>

<h3 id="6.1">6.1. Carthaginian Reinforcements</h3>
<p>The Carthaginian player receives up to four CUs per turn. The Carthaginian reinforcements are placed in the following locations:
<ul>
<li>One in Carthage or with any general in Africa.
<li>One in New Carthage or with any general in Spain if the city of New Carthage is Carthaginian controlled (the city of New Carthage contained the workshops, shipyards and craftsmen that furnished Hannibal&apos;s army).
<li>One in New Carthage or with any general in Spain if the province of Baetica is Carthaginian controlled (this province was rich in silver and financed much of the Carthaginian war effort).
<li>One in any space that contains either a Carthaginian general or in Carthage or New Carthage.
</ul>
<p>DISPLACED CARTHAGINIAN GENERALS: If there are any displaced Carthaginian generals, all are returned to the game after all Carthaginian reinforcements are placed. They may be placed in any space containing one or more Carthaginian CUs that are not currently under siege.

<h3 id="6.2">6.2. Roman Reinforcements</h3>
<p>The Roman player receives five CUs per turn. The CUs may be placed in Rome or with any Roman general(s). At least three of the five Roman CUs must be placed in Italy. The CUs may all be placed in one space or split up in any fashion between Roman generals and Rome. If the Roman player does not have at least one stack containing five or more CUs, then he must (if possible) place enough of his reinforcements in a space so a stack of five CUs is created (this is important for placing Consuls).

<h3 id="6.3">6.3. Restrictions on Placement</h3>
<p>Reinforcements may not be placed inside a besieged Walled City <a href="#20.4">[20.4]</a>. An enemy general without CUs does not restrict the placement of reinforcements and would be displaced <a href="#10.10">[10.10]</a> if reinforcements are placed in that space. If Rome is besieged and all Roman generals are inside Rome, than the Roman player does not receive any reinforcements except those arriving with Scipio Africanus. The same is true with the area specific Carthaginian reinforcements: if New Carthage is besieged and all Carthaginian generals in Spain are inside that city, then the Carthaginian player would lose those two CUs.

<h3 class="pb" id="6.4">6.4. Electing Consuls and Proconsuls</h3>
<p>Rome in 218 B.C. was a republic ruled by the Senate. Wishing to avoid the pitfalls of kings and dictators, the Senate was very careful not to give too much power to military leaders. As such, during a war they would elect two consuls each year to lead the army or armies. At the end of each year two new consuls would be elected, but in some cases a consul would be allowed to remain with his army if the situation required it (or if he was doing well), in which case the Senate made him a proconsul.
<p>PROCEDURE: The Roman player, during the Reinforcement Phase of each turn (except the first), must follow the procedures below for his generals:
<ol>
<li> Designate one of the Roman generals as a proconsul. This is optional but recommended, the Roman player is not required to designate a proconsul, but it allows him to have an extra general in play if he does.
<li> Remove the other Roman generals from the map (except Scipio Africanus if in play).
<li> Randomly draw two generals to be your consuls for the turn (those removed in step 2 are eligible to be drawn again).
<li> Place your two new consuls on the map. Note that the two Roman generals on the map at the start of the game are consuls.
</ol>

<h3 id="6.5">6.5. Consul Placement</h3>
<p>Consuls may be placed together or in separate stacks but must be placed in a space containing at least five Roman CUs (if there is only one such space, then both consuls must be placed together). A consul may be placed with a proconsul, in which case the proconsul becomes a subordinate <a href="#9.2">[9.2]</a>. Roman consuls may be placed inside a besieged Rome (Roman CUs may not) if there is no other legal space they may be placed in.

<h3 id="6.6">6.6. The Proconsul</h3>
<p>A proconsul remains on the map with his current army. You are only allowed one proconsul in play at a time (until the arrival of Scipio Africanus). Each Reinforcement Phase, you may elect to keep your proconsul or dismiss him in favor of designating one of your departing consuls as a proconsul instead. Indicate which general is your proconsul by placing the Proconsul Marker in his Holding Box.

<h3 id="6.7">6.7. Scipio Africanus</h3>
<p>Scipio Africanus arrives in play on turn 6 (211-210 B.C.) as a second proconsul. He brings with him five CUs that are in addition to the five CUs the Roman player normally receives. Scipio and his 5 CUs must be placed as a group; they may not be split up. The Roman player can place Scipio&apos;s army in any space in Italy that contains a friendly PC and no enemy CUs or in any port space in Spain that contains a friendly PC and no enemy CUs. Scipio&apos;s army arrives after the normal five CUs have been placed and before the two new consuls have been elected. He may not be placed inside a Walled City. If there are no such spaces on the map Scipio Africanus and his army does not appear and Scipio Africanus is removed from play. Once on the map Scipio acts as a permanent proconsul for the Roman player allowing him to have two proconsuls in play.

<h2 id="7">7. THE STRATEGY PHASE</h2>

<h3 id="7.1">7.1. Receiving Strategy Cards</h3>
<p>Each player is dealt a number of cards from the Strategy Deck during each turn (seven cards each on turns 1-3, eight cards each on turns 4-6 and nine cards each on turns 7-9).

<h3 id="7.2">7.2. Two Options for Each Card</h3>
<p>Each card played allows the player to either use the Operation Number on the card <a href="#8.2">[8.2]</a>, or cause the event on the card to occur. If you wish to do neither, you may discard.

<h3 id="7.3">7.3. Who Goes First</h3>
<p>Normally the Carthaginian player decides who will move first, but if the Roman player has a Major or Minor Campaign card in his hand and will play it (as an Event or an Operations Card) for his first play in the Strategy Phase, he may choose to go first. Follow this procedure:
<p>The Carthaginian player first asks the Roman player if he is using a campaign card to move first. If not, then the Carthaginian player declares who will move first.

<h3 id="7.4">7.4. Ending the Strategy Phase</h3>
<p>The players continue to alternate playing Strategy Cards until all cards in each player&apos;s hand have been played. At this point, the Strategy Phase ends. It is possible that one player may use all of his Strategy Cards while his opponent still has several left in his hand. In this case, the player who still has Strategy Cards plays them one at a time until he has played all of them.

<h2 class="pb" id="8">8. STRATEGY CARDS</h2>

<h3 id="8.1">8.1. Description</h3>
<p>Each Strategy Card has two primary elements, a number between 1 and 3 in the upper left corner (called the Operation Number) and an event. The operation number is used to activate generals or place PC markers. The event is only available if the operation number is not used. A ship symbol in the upper right corner (on Ops 3s and campaign cards) indicates the card can be used for Sea Movement.

<h3 id="8.2">8.2. Using the Operation Number</h3>
<p>The operation number allows you to do one of the following:
<p>MOVE A GENERAL (with or without CUs) whose Strategy Rating is less than or equal to the operation number.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: A &quot;1&quot; can only move a general with a Strategy Rating of 1. A &quot;2&quot; can move a general with a Strategy Rating of 1 or 2. A &quot;3&quot; can move any general.
<p>Place a quantity of PC Markers on the map equal to the operation number. One PC marker can be placed in each space that doesn&apos;t contain an enemy CU or PC Marker. 
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: If you play a &quot;3&quot;, you could place three of your PC markers.
<p>RAISE TROOPS: This is only allowed with a &quot;3&quot; card. Playing a &quot;3&quot; card in this way allows the player to place one CU with any one general who is located in a friendly controlled space in a friendly controlled province. You may not raise troops in a besieged Walled City <a href="#20.4">[20.4]</a>.

<h3 id="8.3">8.3. Events</h3>
<p>The operation number of each strategy card is color-coded to reflect who can use the event. Events playable only by the Romans have a black background; Carthaginian events have a white background. Events that can be played by either player have a half-black-half-white background. Regardless of the icons depicted, either player can use the operation number of any card.

<h3 id="8.4">8.4. Counter Events</h3>
<p>Events with their title printed in white letters in a black oval (like Marharbal&apos;s Cavalry #5) can be played in the middle of a move or battle. Playing a Counter Event does not count as your normal move; you must still play the next Strategy Card (if you have one). In effect, playing a Counter usually requires you to play two Strategy Cards in a row. Note that the two Hostile Tribes cards (#7 &amp; #8) may be used as a counter or played during your turn if your opponent&apos;s army is still in Liguria or Gallia Transalpinia.

<h3 id="8.5">8.5. Remove if Played Cards</h3>
<p>When an event is played that states &quot;REMOVE IF PLAYED&quot;, the card is removed from the Strategy Deck after it is played because the event may only occur once per game. There is one event which when played twice is removed - Philip of Macedonia. The second playing of the card essentially cancels the initial effect. A &quot;REMOVE IF PLAYED&quot; card is not removed if the event is not used.

<h3 id="8.6">8.6. Discarding</h3>
<p>You may discard a strategy card rather than play it. In this case no action occurs and it now becomes your opponent&apos;s turn to play a strategy card. Discards must be played face up for your opponent to see.

<h3 id="8.7">8.7. Reshuffling</h3>
<p>If there are not enough Strategy Cards in the Strategy Deck to deal a full hand to each player for the upcoming turn, the entire Strategy Deck (excluding cards that have been permanently removed from play) is reshuffled before any cards are dealt. The deck is also reshuffled when the Truce card is played or discarded (it doesn&apos;t matter if the event is used or not). In this case, the deck is reshuffled at the end of the turn.

<h2 class="pb" id="9">9. STACKING AND SUBORDINATION</h2>

<h3 id="9.1">9.1. Stacking CUs</h3>
<p>There is no limit to the number of CUs that can be stacked in a space.

<h3 id="9.2">9.2. Stacking Generals</h3>
<p>There can be more than one general in a space, but only one can be the commanding general. All other generals in the same space are considered subordinates. Keep the commanding general on the map, and place the subordinates in the commanding general&apos;s Holding Box. For example Hanno and M. Gisgo are subordinates to Hannibal at the start of the game. When a commanding general moves, the subordinate generals freely move with him. A subordinate in commanders Holding Box does not affect the commander in any way and while acting as a subordinate his Special Abilities <a href="#24">[24]</a> may not be used.

<h3 id="9.3">9.3. Rank</h3>
<p>Normally, the owning player may decide which of his generals will be the commander and which will be the subordinate and he is free to change the commander before he activates the army. However, if one general outranks another, then the ranking general must be the commander.
<ul>
<li>Hannibal outranks all other Carthaginian generals
<li>Consuls outrank Proconsuls
</ul>

<h2 class="pb" id="10">10. MOVEMENT</h2>

<h3 id="10.1">10.1. Who May Move</h3>
<p>Generals may move with or without CUs. Combat Units (CUs) cannot be moved unless accompanied by a general. A general can be moved only when a strategy card is played that permits it. A general and the CUs stacked with him are collectively called an army. Only one army moves with each strategy card unless a campaign card is played <a href="#10.9">[10.9]</a>. The same army may be activated each strategy card play.

<h3 id="10.2">10.2. Movement Procedure</h3>
<p>You can move a general up to four spaces (six spaces with a Force March Strategy Card). A general can move with up to ten CUs. As you move a general, you can pick up and drop off CUs along the way, so long as there are never more than ten CUs moving with the general at any time. You may move a general into any space that is adjacent (i.e., connected by a line) to the space that the general occupies. The sequence below must be observed when moving an army:
<ol>
<li> Select the general you wish to activate. If there are two or more generals with an army you may designate which is the commanding general, under certain restrictions <a href="#9.3">[9.3]</a>. Then select up to 10 CUs and any number of subordinates to accompany the commanding general.
<li> Play a Strategy Card that can activate the commanding general <a href="#8.2">[8.2]</a>.
<li> Move the army. As the army enters each space it triggers a Reaction Phase for the non-active player <a href="#10.3">[10.3]</a>, which is conducted before proceeding to step 4.
<li> If the non-active player was successful with an Interception, the active army has the option to back up one space and end its move <a href="#12.5">[12.5]</a>.
<li> If there is only one CU in the space the active army may conduct an Overrun at this time.
<li> Repeat steps 3 - 5 until the activated army has completed its move.
<li> The army may now conduct one of the following: either a siege /subjugation attempt or a battle. An army may never conduct a battle and then a siege or subjugation on the play of a single strategy card.
</ol>

<h3 id="10.3">10.3. Reaction Phase</h3>
<p class="example">DESIGNER&apos;S NOTE: This is not a new rule, just a method to organize the existing rules. Each space an army enters may trigger a possible reaction by the non-Active Player. This is called the Reaction Phase and follows this sequence:
<ol>
<li> If the space contains a Walled City the non-active player declares his CUs inside or outside the city and moves them above or below the Walled City Marker as appropriate.
<li> The non-active player declares all his Interceptions and Avoid Battle Attempts. All must be declared before any are carried out and the non-active player is required to attempt all those he designated.
<li> If an Avoid Battle were declared; the non-active player must roll for its success and, if successful, move the army from the space.
<li> If any Interceptions were declared, the non-active player must conduct them now (in any order he wishes). An army intercepting into a space may not duck into a Walled City since non-phasing CUs can only enter Walled Cities during step 1 above. This completes the Reaction Phase.
</ol>

<h3 id="10.4">10.4. Enemy Occupied Spaces</h3>
<p>When you move an army into a space containing one or more enemy CUs, and those enemy CUs do not, cannot, or fail to Avoid Battle <a href="#13">[13]</a>, your army must stop, end its movement and battle the enemy force (exception: <a href="#10.5">[10.5]</a>). A general without an army may not move into a space containing an enemy army nor stop in a space containing an enemy general without an army (he may pass through such a space).

<h3 id="10.5">10.5. Overruns</h3>
<p>If your army has at least five CUs and it enters a space containing a single enemy CU without a general, the CU is automatically eliminated with no loss to you. Do not deal out BCs. Your army can continue its movement with no loss to its momentum. There is no restriction on the number of times your army may do this in a single turn - it is only limited by the general&apos;s movement ability. Two CUs cannot be overrun by 10 CUs.

<h3 id="10.6">10.6. Mountain Passes and Straits</h3>
<p>Movement across mountain passes (Alps and Non-Alps Passes) and across straits costs two instead of one from your general&apos;s movement capability.
<ul>
<li>MOUNTAIN PASS ATTRITION: Each time an army crosses a mountain pass it must roll for attrition <a href="#21.1">[21.1]</a> immediately after crossing the pass. If the mountain pass was a Non-Alps Pass, modify your die roll by -2. There is no modifier for crossing an Alps Pass.
<li>STRAITS: Movement across the Strait of Massena is allowed only if you control both Rhegium and Massena. Notice that both players could use naval movement between these ports. Movement across the Strait of Sardinia is allowed regardless of control.
<li>OTHER EFFECTS: Interception <a href="#12">[12]</a>, Avoid Battle <a href="#13">[13]</a>, Withdrawals <a href="#14.11">[14.11]</a> and Retreats <a href="#15">[15]</a> are prohibited across mountain passes (both types) and straits.
</ul>

<h3 id="10.7">10.7. Walled Cities and Movement</h3>
<p>Players should consider a Walled City as a space within a space. Generals and CUs can be inside or outside of the city. The number of CUs that can fit inside a city is limited; Rome and Carthage can hold 5 CUs, and all other walled cities can hold two CUs. To indicate CUs inside a Walled City, place them beneath the Walled City Marker. Those on top of the marker are considered outside the city. Generals inside a city can be placed to the side of the Walled City Marker. CUs that remain outside of the city stop enemy movement; CUs inside the city do not. You may move your CUs and generals from inside a Walled City to outside of a Walled City (and vice versa) in the following situations:
<ul>
<li>ACTIVE PLAYER: Through normal movement (the play of a Strategy Card) during your player turn. Movement into a city is usually the last act of a moving army <a href="#10.2">[10.2]</a>.
<li>NON-ACTIVE PLAYER: If an enemy army enters a non-besieged Walled City spaces and the non-active player has CUs or generals there, he may declare the CUs and/or generals inside or outside. His decision may change each time an enemy force enters the space.
</ul>

<h3 id="10.8">10.8. Combining Armies</h3>
<p>An activated general may pick up another general (with or without CUs) and keep moving. The general being picked must become a subordinate for that move. A general that outranks the activated general may not be picked up. If a general ends its move in a space containing another general and the new general outranks the activated general, then the activating general becomes a subordinate. If a general ends its move in a space containing another general of equal rank, then the activated general becomes the commanding general and the other general becomes a subordinate.

<h3 id="10.9">10.9. Dividing Armies</h3>
<p>An army may drop off subordinate generals (with or without CUs) at any time. A subordinate in the commanding general&apos;s Holding Box may be activated and moved off with as many CUs from the commanding general&apos;s army as the controlling player wishes (exception: <a href="#18.1">[18.1]</a>). Bring the subordinate back onto the map and use the space occupied by the commander as his starting space. The subordinate becomes the commanding general of this new army and may bring along other subordinates that do not outrank him. A subordinate that detaches and moves off counts as moving one general (i.e., activating a subordinate does not allow the commanding general to move).

<h3 id="10.10">10.10. Displaced Generals</h3>
<p>A general becomes displaced if an enemy army enters the general&apos;s space and the general is not accompanied by friendly CUs. A general also becomes displaced if all CUs accompanying the general are eliminated due to Retreat Table casualties, Retreat losses or the Naval Table. A general is not displaced if all CUs under his command are removed due to the Attrition Table, the Storms at Sea event (#60) or the Battle Casualties die roll.
<ul>
<li>If Scipio Africanus is displaced, he is eliminated.
<li>If Hannibal is displaced he is eliminated and the Carthaginian player must remove 5 PC markers from any spaces on the map. This is in addition to any PCs losses resulting from the battle that led to Hannibal&apos;s death.
<li>A displaced general is removed from the map and does not return to play until the next Reinforcement Phase <a href="#5">[5]</a>.
</ul>

<h3 id="10.11">10.11. Campaign Card Limitations</h3>
<p>When a campaign card is played each commanding general must complete all movement and battles before another general can be activated. A CU or subordinate moved by one general during a campaign can be moved by another general during the same Campaign as long as no CU or general moves more than four spaces (exception: Nero). Once an army participates in a battle, siege, subjugation, or backs up one space to avoid being intercepted <a href="#12">[12]</a>, or fails its Pursuit die roll <a href="#13.2">[13.2]</a>; all CUs and generals in the army are considered to have spent all their movement capability and may not be moved by another general during that campaign.
<p>SIEGES AND SUBJUGATION: A campaign card cannot be used to conduct more than one siege or subjugation against the same walled city or tribe, but it could be used to battle the defenders from the space and then used again to conduct a siege or subjugation against the site, as long as a different general performed each action.

<h3 id="10.12">10.12. Nero</h3>
<p>Nero has the special ability to move 6 spaces during campaigns. CUs and subordinates that accompany Nero may move six spaces as long as their entire movement is with him (i.e., they cannot be moved four spaces by one general and then two more with Nero).

<h2 class="pb" id="11">11. NAVAL MOVEMENT</h2>

<h3 id="11.1">11.1. Procedure</h3>
<p>A general (with or without CUs) may move from a port space to any other port space using Naval Movement. CUs by themselves may not use Naval Movement. Naval Movement is possible when a 3-strategy card or a Campaign event is played (a ship icon appears in the upper right-hand corner of such cards for easy recognition). The movement cost to use Naval Movement is equal to three spaces.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: You can move one space to a port and then use Naval Movement; or you can start at a port, use Naval Movement and then move one space inland.

<h3 id="11.2">11.2. Enemy Controlled Ports</h3>
<p>Control of a port is not necessary for embarkation or debarkation. Naval Movement is allowed into and out of any port space including a port that contains an enemy PC or CUs.

<h3 id="11.3">11.3. Naval Movement and Walled Cities</h3>
<p>Naval Movement directly into a Walled City (as oppose to simply landing outside the city) is allowed if the walled city is friendly controlled and not currently besieged (<a href="#20.4">[20.4]</a> for definition of &quot;besieged&quot;). Naval Movement is prohibited into and out of besieged Walled Cities. Note that this does not prevent Naval Movement into and out of a space containing a besieged walled city (in this case the troops are considered embarking or debarking outside the city walls).

<h3 id="11.4">11.4. Sea Movement Limit</h3>
<p>A major or minor campaign allows an army with up to 10 CUs to use naval movement (only one of the two or three armies that may move with a campaign card can use Naval movement). A 3 OC allows one army with up to five CUs to use sea movement.

<h3 id="11.5">11.5. Roman Naval Supremacy</h3>
<p>The Roman player enjoys naval supremacy, so any Carthaginian Sea Movement runs the risk of being sunk. Each time a Carthaginian general or army moves by sea, the Roman player rolls on the Naval Combat Table. If after applying the appropriate die roll modifiers, the force is sunk, then the CUs are eliminated and the general is displaced <a href="#10.10">[10.10]</a>. If the force must return, it returns to the port of embarkation and the balance of its movement is lost. CUs lost at sea do not count towards Political Consequences <a href="#15.5">[15.5]</a>.

<h3 class="pb" id="11.6">11.6. Naval Combat Table Modifiers</h3>
<p>The Roman player modifies his Naval Combat Table die roll appropriately:
<ul>
<li>+/- both port modifiers* (see map)
<li>-1 if a general is moving without CUs or if the army using Sea Movement contains only one CU. Note that the table printed on the map implies that a CU can move by itself -- this is wrong; a CU can only move with a general.
<li>+1 if the port contains a Roman PC marker*
<li>-1 if Carthage controls Syracuse
<li>-1 if Macedonia is allied with Carthage (Event #9)
<li>-1 if the Carthaginian Naval Victory (Event #29) is in effect.
</ul>
<p class="footnote">* These modifiers apply to both the port from which the army departs and the port at which they debarks, and they are cumulative.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: Your Carthaginian opponent sends an army from Carthage (port modifier: -2) to New Carthage (port modifier: - 2); the cumulative modifier is -4.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: He sends an army with only one CU (-1) from New Carthage (-2) to Rhegium (+1). Rhegium contains a Roman PC giving you another +1 modifier. The net modifier is (-1) + (-2) + (+1) + (+1) = -1.

<h2 class="pb" id="12">12. INTERCEPTION</h2>

<h3 id="12.1">12.1. In General</h3>
<p>Interception is a special kind of movement that allows a non-active army to advance one space during an opposing general&apos;s move and interrupt the movement of the enemy army. Interception forces the moving army to fight a battle <a href="#14">[14]</a> or back up one space <a href="#12.5">[12.5]</a>.

<h3 id="12.2">12.2. When Can an Interception Occur?</h3>
<p>Any army controlled by the non-active player may attempt interception. An interception can occur whenever an enemy army or general enters (via land or naval movement) a space adjacent to the army and the space does not contain any non-moving enemy CUs. An army may attempt interception each time the above condition occurs, for example if an enemy army tried to move around your army you could attempt to intercept in each adjacent space which did not contain an enemy CU.

<h3 id="12.3">12.3. Interception Restrictions</h3>
<ul>
<li>You may not intercept into a space that contains one or more non-moving enemy CUs.
<li>You may not intercept across a Mountain Pass or Strait.
<li>Interceptions may only occur against movement. You cannot intercept an attempt to Avoid Battle <a href="#13.1">[13.1]</a>, a Withdrawal <a href="#14.12">[14.12]</a>, or a Retreat <a href="#15">[15]</a>, nor may you intercept an interception.
</ul>

<h3 id="12.4">12.4. Interception Attempt Die Roll</h3>
<p>To intercept, roll the die. Modify the die roll by +1 if the space your army is intercepting into contains an enemy PC marker and no friendly CUs. If the modified die roll is less than or equal to your commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating, the interception attempt is successful. If your interception attempt succeeds, you must move the general and all CUs you declared were participating in the interception, into the space. In a battle caused by a successful interception, the intercepting player receives one extra Battle Card to simulate the effects of surprise. One is the maximum benefit, even if two or more armies intercepted.

<h3 id="12.5">12.5. Backing Up One Space</h3>
<p>An army intercepted is never required to give battle; it may instead back up to its last-occupied space and end its movement. If an army has to back up across a pass, it must roll for attrition again. If an army has to back off from a sea move, then it returns to its port of embarkation. If it were a Carthaginian sea move, the Carthaginian player would have to roll again on the naval combat table. If the result is a Return than the Carthaginian player may not back up and must land in the port space. If an army backs up on to an enemy Walled City or Tribe space it may still conduct a siege or subjugation on that site.

<h3 id="12.6">12.6. Multiple Interceptions</h3>
<p>You may conduct more than one interception attempt into the same space if you have more than one army adjacent to the space your opponent is about to enter. In this case, you must declare all interception attempts before any are resolved, and your opponent may wait until all are resolved before he decides to give battle or back up. If both/all interceptions succeed, then the armies are combined in the space under the command of one general and the combined force faces the moving army.

<h3 id="12.7">12.7. Subordinates and Interceptions</h3>
<p>You may dispatch a portion of your army (under a subordinate or the commander) for an interception. You must declare which general and how many CUs will make the attempt. No matter how many subordinates an army has, only one interception can initiate from each space (i.e., you may not make two or more interception attempts from the same space in hopes that at least one will make it). If a subordinate intercepts, the commanding general must be left behind with at least one CU (note that consuls may not be voluntarily left with less than 5 CUs <a href="#18.1">[18.1]</a>).

<h3 id="12.8">12.8. Interceptions and Walled Cities</h3>
<p>An army inside a Walled City may intercept an army in an adjacent space if there is no enemy CUs outside the Walled City. Conversely, if you intercept an army that enters a Walled City space by land movement, the battle occurs before the army can enter the walled city. If the army entered the Walled City space via naval movement, the intercepted army has four options: accept battle, back up into the walled city (if the city can fit the army), back up to the port of embarkation, or split the army between the last two options. An army backing up one space may never leave behind CUs outside the walled city.

<h3 id="12.9">12.9. Interceptions and Overruns</h3>
<p>Overruns occur after interceptions, so an intercepting army may prevent an overrun.

<h3 id="12.10">12.10. Failed Interceptions and Avoid Battle</h3>
<p>If an army fails an interception attempt it is prohibited from attempting an avoid battle against that same army during the current card play. The army that failed the interception may still attempt other interceptions without restrictions, and may even attempt to avoid battle against other armies if the current card play is a campaign.

<h2 class="pb" id="13">13. AVOIDING BATTLES AND PURSUIT</h2>

<h3 id="13.1">13.1. Avoid Battle</h3>
<p>This option is available to the non-active player only. If an enemy army enters a space containing one of your armies or one or more of your generals without CUs, you may attempt to avoid battle. To determine if the attempt succeeds, roll the die. If the die roll is less than or equal to your commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating, the Avoid Battle succeeds. A successful Avoid Battle allows you to move your army or generals out of the space and into any adjacent space (see restrictions below). If the die roll was greater than the commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating, then the army/generals remains in the space and a battle is resolved (or the generals are displaced). For botching the retreat and for the temporary reduction in moral this would cause, you receive one less Battle Card in the ensuing battle.

<h3 id="13.2">13.2. Restrictions on Avoiding Battle</h3>
<ul>
<li>No more than 10 CUs may avoid battle. An army that contains more than 10 CUs must leave behind all CUs in excess of 10.
<li>CUs and generals that failed an interception attempt may not attempt to avoid battle against the same army in the current round <a href="#12.10">[12.10]</a>.
<li>An army or general avoiding battle may leave CUs and/or generals behind (as long as <a href="#18.1">[18.1]</a> is not violated).
<li>May not cross a mountain pass or strait.
<li>May not enter a space containing an enemy CU or PC marker.
<li>May not enter the space from which the enemy army is advancing.
<li>May not enter a non-friendly tribe space.
</ul>

<h3 id="13.3">13.3. Subordinates and Avoid Battle</h3>
<p>You may avoid battle with a subordinate. In this case the commanding general must be left behind with at least one CU (or 5 CUs if leaving behind a consul <a href="#18.1">[18.1]</a>). Only one avoid battle attempt is allowed per Reaction Phase, so generals may not split up and avoid battle into different spaces, nor may you avoid battle with one general after failing with another.

<h3 id="13.4">13.4. Pursuit</h3>
<p>If your opponent successfully Avoided Battle, you may attempt to continue moving (either to pursue or to move off in a different direction). To determine if the attempt is successful, roll the die. If the die roll is less than or equal to your general&apos;s Battle Rating, your army can continue to move. If your general has already moved the four-space limit (or six spaces if moving with a Force March card), or the die roll is greater than his Battle Rating, then your army must stop in its current space. If your army pursues the army that avoided battle, then your opponent can try to avoid battle again, and you may attempt to pursue again. This can continue until your opponent fails his avoid battle die roll or your general has moved his limit.

<h3 id="13.5">13.5. Walled Cities and Avoid Battle</h3>
<p>An army located in a Walled City space but currently outside the city has two options. The controlling player may declare the army inside the city when the enemy army appears or he may declare the army outside the city and attempt an avoid battle. The first case would not slow the movement of the enemy army, but the second case might (if the avoid battle succeeds and the pursuit does not).

<h3 id="13.6">13.6. Sieges/Subjugation and Pursuit</h3>
<p>An army that fails its pursuit die roll but ends its move on a Walled City or Tribe space may still conduct a siege or subjugation against the site.

<h2 class="pb" id="14">14. BATTLES</h2>

<h3 id="14.1">14.1. Battle Cards (BC)</h3>
<p>Battles are resolved using Battle Cards. After the battle is over, all BCs are shuffled back into the Battle Card Deck. Each player draws a number of BCs as described below:
<ul>
<li>A number of BCs equal to the commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating (if a general is present).
<li>One BC for each CU he has present in the battle.
<li>One BC for a successful interception <a href="#12.4">[12.4]</a>.
<li>One less BC for the defending army if it unsuccessfully attempted to avoid battle <a href="#13.1">[13.1]</a>.
<li>A variable number of BCs for Allies <a href="#14.2">[14.2]</a>
<li>The Roman player receives two BCs for any battle in Latium <a href="#14.3">[14.3]</a>
<li>One BC if the battle space contains a friendly Tribe <a href="#20.9">[20.9]</a>
</ul>
<p>20 CARD LIMIT: Regardless of other factors, a player&apos;s maximum BC hand size (before consideration of any possible reduction for an elephant charge) is 20 cards. Any additional BCs beyond 20 are forfeit.

<h3 id="14.2">14.2. Allies</h3>
<p>Players receive additional BCs for having allies. A player gains allies by having Political Control of provinces (determined at the moment of the battle). Each province is worth one BC except Eastern and Western Numidia that are worth two. Some Allies will not venture beyond their province, and hence, their BC bonus is only available inside the province. However, the allies in Africa, Spain and Italy (see glossary) are available in any province within their country (these countries are color coded on the map).
<p>ISLAND PROVINCES: Allies on islands (Baleric Islands, Sicilia, Syracuse, Sardinia/Corsica) are only available for battles on that island. Sardinia and Corsica are considered one island for this rule.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: Carthage controls three provinces in Spain while Rome controls one. No matter where the battle takes place in Spain, the Carthaginian Player will receive three BCs for allies while the Roman Player will receive one.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: The battle is in Africa. Carthage controls Carthage and Carthaginia, while Rome controls Western Numidia. In this case, both players would receive two BCs for allies.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: The battle is in Sicilia, which is outside of Italy. Whoever controls Sicilia would receive one BC for allies, who ever controls Syracuse would receive one BC. No other allies are possible.

<h3 id="14.3">14.3. Restrictions on Allies</h3>
<ul>
<li>GENERALS: You may only receive bonus cards for allies if you have a general in the battle. If multiple battles occur in the same province or country during the play of a campaign card, all battles would receive the bonus for allies as long as they had generals present.
<li>ITALIAN ALLIES: The Roman player may never receive more than two BCs for allies in Italy and may not count the province of Latium for allies. This reflects that these provinces are already supplying the Roman Legions with recruits and so are already reflected in the design. The Carthaginian player can have up to six allies in Italy (Campania, Lucania, Apulia, Samnium, Etruria and Gallia Cisalpinia).
</ul>
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: The battle is at Cannae, in Italy. The Carthaginian player controls Gallia Cisalpinia and Lucania. The Roman player controls Campania, Samnium and Etruria. Neither side controls Apulia. Both sides would receive two extra BCs for allies.
<p>NOTE: The Battle Card Bonus/Penalty List on the map states that Rome may not use Allies in Italy - this is incorrect.

<h3 id="14.4">14.4. Militia</h3>
<p>Rome receives two extra BCs for any battle that occurs in Latium (this is in addition to any BCs for Italian Allies). This militia is available even if there is no General present in Rome.

<h3 id="14.5">14.5. Sequence of Battle Resolution</h3>
<p>The player whose moving army started the battle begins as the attacker and the other player as the defender. Each battle is conducted separately, so the identity of the attacker and defender can change from battle to battle (and indeed, from round to round during a battle). Prepare for battle using this sequence:
<ol>
<li>Change of Command die roll <a href="#18.2">[18.2]</a>
<li>Attacker declares battle-related strategy cards.
<li>Defender declares battle-related strategy cards.
<li>Elephant charge declaration <a href="#17.3">[17.3]</a> and charge die-roll, unless Elephant Fright (#42) is immediately played before die roll.
<li>Deal BCs, display cards revealed by spy and begin battle.
</ol>

<h3 id="14.6">14.6. Battle Round</h3>
<p>A battle is fought in Battle Rounds. In each battle round, first the attacker plays a BC and then the defender must play a BC that matches <a href="#14.7">[14.7]</a> the attacker&apos;s BC. If the defender is unable or unwilling to match the attacker&apos;s BC, he loses the battle. If the defender&apos;s BC matches the attacker&apos;s BC, another battle round must be played. The players continue playing out battle rounds until one wins.

<h3 id="14.7">14.7. Matching the Attacker&apos;s Battle Card</h3>
<p>The defender matches the attacker&apos;s BC by playing one of exactly the same type. Thus a Frontal Attack card is matched by another Frontal Attack card, a Probe card is matched by a Probe card, and so on.
<p class="example">BATTLE TIP: If you are the attacker, usually the best card to play is the type that is predominant in your hand. With only 48 cards in the Battle Card Deck, if you have many of one type, your opponent is likely to have only a few. Examine the inventory <a href="#2.1">[2.1]</a> at the beginning of this rule booklet for the number and type of cards in the Battle Card Deck.

<h3 id="14.8">14.8. Counterattacks</h3>
<p>After each battle round, the defender may attempt to counterattack. If successful, he becomes the attacker in the next battle round, and the former attacker becomes the defender. To attempt a counterattack, the defender rolls the die. If the die roll is less than or equal to his commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating, he has seized the initiative and become the attacker. If the die roll is greater than his general&apos;s Battle Rating, he fails and remains the defender in the next battle round.
<p>DOUBLE ENVELOPMENT EXCEPTION: If the attacker plays a Double Envelopment and the defender matches it, then the defender can automatically (though its not mandatory) gain the initiative and become the attacker (the Double Envelopment tactic was a difficult and dangerous tactic to attempt). Note that this would be the only way for a force with no general to become the attacker.

<h3 id="14.9">14.9. Reserve Cards</h3>
<p>There are four Reserve cards in the battle deck. These cards are wild cards that may be used as any of the other five types of cards (Frontal Assault, Flank Left, Flank Right, Probe or Double Envelopment). Reserve cards can be used by the attacker or by the defender (to match a card). When the attacker plays a reserve card, he must state which type of card it is representing and it takes on all characteristics of that card (i.e., a Reserve card used as a Double Envelopment will result in an automatic loss of initiative if matched).

<h3 id="14.10">14.10. How to Win a Battle</h3>
<ul>
<li>The attacker wins if the defender cannot or will not match his battle card.
<li>The defender wins if the attacker has no BCs remaining at the beginning of a battle round (even if the defender also has no BCs remaining).
</ul>

<h3 id="14.11">14.11. Battle Casualties</h3>
<p>After the victor has been determined, players roll on the Attrition Table to determine the number of CUs that must be removed by both sides for battle casualties. The number of rounds that occurred in the battle determines the column to use on the table. The last round in the battle (the one in which the defender could not match the attacker) is counted as a full round. Players cross-reference the column with a die roll to determine the number of CUs eliminated.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: The battle lasted four rounds and a &quot;5&quot; is rolled for Battle Casualties. The result is both players lose one CU.
<p>CALCULATING ROUNDS: Failed withdraw attempts do not count as a round. It is recommended that players keep the battle cards they play in separate piles so that the number of rounds may be easily determined.

<h3 id="14.12">14.12. The Retreat Table</h3>
<p>In addition to battle casualties, the loser of the battle will lose a number of CUs as determined by the Retreat Table. After each battle, the loser must roll the die and consult the Retreat Table. The column on the left is used if the loser&apos;s army began the battle with less than or equal to four CUs. The column on the right of the Retreat Table is used if the loser&apos;s army began the battle with greater than four CUs. Losses must be taken in CUs; they cannot be absorbed with allies or militia. The die roll is modified by +2 if the battle was won with a Double Envelopment or by -2 if won with a Probe.
<p>ELEPHANTS: If there are elephant CUs in the defeated army the first CU removed must be an elephant CU. All other loses may come from non-elephant CUs. Note that a player could lose two elephant CUs in a battle if he lost the first with a die roll of 6 in Battle Attrition and then lost the second on the retreat table.
<p>ALL CARDS EXHAUSTED: There is no die roll modifier to the retreat table when the attacker loses by running out of cards. Simply use the face value of the die roll on the retreat table.

<h2 class="pb" id="15">15. RETREATS</h2>

<h3 id="15.1">15.1. Retreat Procedure</h3>
<p>After battle casualties and retreat table losses have been removed, the loser of a battle must retreat his force and suffer the political consequences of the defeat. The loser of the battle must retreat to a space that is both friendly controlled (contains a friendly PC) and clear of enemy CUs or to a space that contains more friendly CUs than the retreating force. If you have more than one space that you may retreat your force to, you must pick the closest one (if two or more are equidistant, the retreating player may choose). You may not leave behind any CUs or generals as you retreat, and any friendly CUs encountered along the retreat path (if they do not outnumber the retreating CUs) are swept up in the retreat and become part of the retreating force. The 10 CU movement limit does not apply during retreats; any size force (commanded by a general or not) defeated in battle must be retreated.
<p>RETREAT PATHS WHICH CAUSE CU LOSSES: A player may, at his option, choose a retreat path or destination which is not the closest if it will cause fewer CU losses <a href="#15.3">[15.3]</a> than the shortest path and does not violate rule 15.2.

<h3 id="15.2">15.2. Restrictions on Retreats</h3>
<ul>
<li>The retreat may not cross a mountain pass (either type) or strait.
<li>The length of the retreat may not be more than four spaces.
<li>The retreat may not use Naval Movement. If the losing army debarked in the battle space that round, it is eliminated. Exception: If the battle space contains a Walled City friendly to the retreating army, it is assumed the army debarked in the city and marched out. The army may therefore retreat into the Walled City. Any CUs which cannot fit inside the Walled City are eliminated.
<li>If the original attacker retreats, he must always retreat first into the space in which he entered the battle. If the original defender retreats, he is prohibited from entering the space from which the attacker entered the battle from during the full length of his retreat.
<li>The retreating force may never reenter the battle space during its retreat.
</ul>

<h3 id="15.3">15.3. Penalties on Retreats</h3>
<ul>
<li>A retreating force (army or CUs) must lose one additional CU for each space it enters that contains an enemy PC marker or non-friendly tribe.
<li>A force retreated into a space containing enemy CUs will lose an additional CU for each enemy CU in the space.A retreating force may not remain in a space with enemy CUs. Enemy generals without CUs have no affect on retreats and cannot block retreat paths.
<li>A force that cannot retreat, has no place to retreat to or must retreat more than four spaces is eliminated.
</ul>

<h3 id="15.4">15.4. Retreats into Walled Cities</h3>
<p>A retreating force is never allowed to retreat into a besieged walled city except the force (if any) that sorties from the city <a href="#20.7">[20.7]</a>. A retreating force may retreat into a friendly controlled non-besieged city if the battle occurred in the Walled City space. If there are more CUs in the retreating force than the city can hold, then the retreating force may split up into two forces; one into the city and the other retreating to a legal retreat space. The commanding general and subordinates may accompany either force or be split up in any fashion (be careful not to violate <a href="#18.1">[18.1]</a>). This is the only way a retreating force may be split up.

<h3 id="15.5">15.5. Political Consequences</h3>
<p>The loser must now remove a number of his own non-Walled City, non-Tribal PC markers from the map equal to half (round fractions down) the number of CUs he lost in the battle (this includes battle attrition casualties, Retreat Table losses, and CUs lost during the retreat). The PCs may come from anywhere on the map he wishes.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: If the loser of the battle lost three CUs then he would have to remove one PC. If he lost only one CU he would not be required to lose any PCs. The loser will no doubt pick PC markers in the least critical areas. This area would probably be receiving little attention and wealth from the controlling country and would be the first to rebel.

<h3 id="15.6">15.6. Sue for Peace</h3>
<p>If, as a result of battle, the loser is unable to remove enough PC markers to satisfy the Political Consequences of defeat, the player must instantly sue for peace, thereby losing the game <a href="#22.3">[22.3]</a>.

<h2 class="pb" id="16">16. WITHDRAWALS</h2>

<h3 id="16.1">16.1. In General</h3>
<p>Withdrawals are a way for the current attacker (not necessarily the original attacker) to break off from a battle. To withdraw, the attacker must forfeit his chance to play a BC and roll less than or equal to his commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating. The defender can cancel the withdrawal by rolling less than or equal to his commanding general&apos;s Battle Rating (the defender is not required to roll). If the attacker&apos;s withdraw die roll was not successful, or if the defender canceled the withdrawal, the defender MAY immediately take the initiative and become the attacker. There is no limit to the number of times you may attempt to withdraw in a single battle.

<h3 id="16.2">16.2. A Successful Withdrawal</h3>
<p>A successful withdrawal ends the battle and forces the withdrawing player to move his army to an adjacent space (exception: units that sallied forth from a besieged walled city may withdraw back into it). Battle casualties are resolved normally, but the Retreat Table is not used.

<h3 id="16.3">16.3. Restrictions on Withdrawals</h3>
<ul>
<li>A withdrawing army may not split up.
<li>An army may not withdraw across a mountain pass (either type), strait or by sea.
<li>You may not withdraw into a space containing an enemy PC marker or enemy CU.
<li>You may not withdraw into the space from which the enemy army entered the battle space. If the original attacker withdrawals, then he must withdraw to the space from which he advanced.
<li>You may not withdraw into a space containing a non-friendly tribe.
</ul>

<h2 class="pb" id="17">17. ELEPHANTS</h2>
<p>The Carthaginian used elephants as a shock weapon in battles. The sight of elephants bearing down on them was often enough to make many troops break and run. Some Roman generals learned how to defend against elephants (frighten them back the other way).

<h3 id="17.1">17.1. Receiving Elephants</h3>
<p>There are two Carthaginian counters (a total of four CUs) that are accompanied by Elephants. One begins the game with Hannibal (on its 2 CU side) and the other may arrive in Carthage with the play of the Elephant Reinforcement EC. The two counters are an intentional limitation, and may not be exceeded.

<h3 id="17.2">17.2. Properties</h3>
<p>CUs with Elephants have all the same properties as regular CUs (they may use Naval Movement) except that they provide a special attack capability to the Carthaginian player <a href="#17.3">[17.3]</a>. When removing CUs lost because of battle casualties <a href="#14.11">[14.11]</a> or attrition <a href="#21">[21]</a>, the Carthaginian player may pick any CUs he wishes unless dictated to remove a CU with Elephants by an &quot;E&quot; result on the Attrition Table. When removing CUs due to the Retreat Table <a href="#14.12">[14.12]</a>, the first CU selected must be an Elephant CU.

<h3 id="17.3">17.3. Elephants in Combat</h3>
<p>CUs with Elephants give the Carthaginian an opportunity to subtract BCs from the Roman at the start of a battle. If the Carthaginian player has CUs with Elephants present in a battle space, he may declare an Elephant Charge. If an Elephant Charge is to be made, it must be declared before the Carthaginian player observes his BCs. The Elephant Charge is successful if the Carthaginian player makes a die roll greater than the Battle Rating of the Roman general in command of the opposing army. If the die roll is less than or equal to the Roman general&apos;s Battle Rating, the Elephants have no effect (although the CUs can still be used in the battle). If there is no Roman general present, the Elephant Charge is unsuccessful on a die roll of 1.

<h3 id="17.4">17.4. Successful Elephant Charges</h3>
<p>If the charge is successful, the Roman battle card hand is reduced by the number of Elephant CUs involved in the charge.

<h3 id="17.5">17.5. Rampaging Elephants</h3>
<p>If a &quot;1&quot; is rolled, then the Carthaginian hand size is immediately reduced by one BC (no matter how many CUs with Elephants were involved in the charge). Being more familiar with elephants, an elephant reversal would not be as detrimental to the Carthaginian army.

<h2 class="pb" id="18">18. CONSULS AND CONSULAR ARMIES</h2>
<p>The two Roman Consuls had no authority over each other. Each was given command of approximately equal forces and this caused considerable coordination problems when they needed to combine. It was not uncommon for Consuls to share command of the combined army by allowing one to command one day and the other the next day.

<h3 id="18.1">18.1. Consular Armies</h3>
<p>A Roman army containing one or both consuls is called a Consular Army. The Roman player may never take any voluntary action that would leave a Consul or a Consular Army with less than 5 CUs. This means that a Consular Army may not exit a space and leave any CUs behind unless it brings at least 5 CUs with it. It also means that once both consuls are together, they may not split up until the Consular Army contains at least 10 CUs. There is no penalty if a Consular Army falls below five CUs due to attrition, battle or retreat; and if it does, it may not drop off or leave behind CUs until it again contains more than five CUs.

<h3 id="18.2">18.2. Change of Command Die Roll</h3>
<p>If both consuls are in the same Consular Army the Roman player may choose either one to move (command) the army; the other becomes a subordinate. If this army containing both consuls enters battle as the attacker, the Carthaginian player may make a Change of Command Die Roll to see if the acting commander changes. If a Carthaginian army attacks this army, the Carthaginian player MUST make a change of command die roll.
<p>PROCEDURE: Roll one die, if the die roll is 1-3, there is no change; if the die roll is 4-6, the commander and subordinate Consuls exchange positions.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: The consuls Marcellus and Varro are stacked together. The Roman player designates Marcellus as the commander and activates the army. The army moves to give battle. Before Battle cards are dealt, the Carthaginian player rolls a Change of Command Die Roll and rolls a &quot;5&quot;. This results in the Consuls exchanging positions, and so Varro commands the army for the battle.

<h3 id="18.3">18.3. Proconsuls and Consuls</h3>
<p>A consul outranks a proconsul and whenever the proconsul ends its move with a consul he becomes a subordinate. However, an army led by a proconsul is allowed to be larger than the Consular Armies and may pass through, a Consular Army containing 5 or more CUs without restrictions. If an army led by a proconsul enters a space containing a Consular Army with less than 5 CUs it must either stop and ends it movement, or drop off enough CUs so the Consular Army once again has 5 CUs. A proconsul that starts the turn stacked with a Consular Army may be activated and sent off with up to 10 CUs, or left behind with any number of CUs, as long as rule 18.1 is not violated.
<p>First edition rules which prevented a proconsul from leaving a Consular Army with more CUs than the Consular Army, and required that a Consular Army stop upon entering a space containing an army led by a proconsul if that proconsul&apos;s army is larger, are no longer in affect.

<h2 class="pb" id="19">19. POLITICAL CONTROL</h2>

<h3 id="19.1">19.1. Political Control</h3>
<p>Players gain control of a space and control of a province through placement of PC markers. A player controls a space if he has a PC marker in it. A player controls a Province if he controls the majority of the spaces in the Province (having the majority of the PC markers in a province is not by itself sufficient for Political Control). A space containing a PC marker remains under the control of the owning player even if an enemy general and/or CUs are also present.

<h3 id="19.2">19.2. Placing PC Markers</h3>
<p>Strategy cards can be played to place PC markers on the map. The number of PC markers that can be placed is equal to the operation number. You can place PC markers in any space that does not contain a PC marker or an enemy CU. Exception: You can place a PC marker in a space containing an enemy PC marker (by flipping it over) if you have a CU in that space.

<h3 id="19.3">19.3. Characteristics of PC Markers</h3>
<ul>
<li>PC markers do not stop or slow movement of units.
<li>Interception attempts into a space containing an enemy PC marker and no friendly CUs are more difficult <a href="#12.4">[12.4]</a>.
<li>You may not avoid battle into a space containing an enemy PC marker <a href="#13.2">[13.2]</a>
<li>A retreat must end in a space containing a friendly PC marker <a href="#15.1">[15.1]</a>.
<li>An army that Retreats through an enemy PC marker must remove an additional CU <a href="#15.3">[15.3]</a>.
<li>An army may not withdraw from battle into a space that contains an enemy PC marker <a href="#16.3">[16.3]</a>.
<li>CUs on enemy PCs at the end of the turn suffer attrition <a href="#21.1">[21.1]</a>.
</ul>

<h3 id="19.4">19.4. Removing Isolated PC Markers</h3>
<p>During the Political Isolation Phase, each player (starting with the Roman Player) must remove all his non-walled, non-tribal PC markers that are isolated. A PC marker is isolated if the player cannot trace a path of spaces from the PC marker to a friendly CU or a friendly controlled Walled City, Tribe or port. A besieged Walled City can still supply other PC markers. The path cannot cross a mountain pass, nor enter a space containing an enemy PC marker or neutral Tribe unless a friendly CU is present in that space. The path may enter and exit a space that contains enemy CUs only if the space also contains a friendly PC.

<h2 class="pb" id="20">20. SIEGES AND SUBJUGATION</h2>

<h3 id="20.1">20.1. Converting Walled Cities and Tribes</h3>
<p>Walled Cities and Tribes are PC markers that are difficult to convert. The only way to convert a Walled City is to conduct a successful siege against it or to play an event card that affects it. The only way to remove a Tribe is to subjugate it.

<h3 id="20.2">20.2. Siege and Subjugation Procedure</h3>
<p>A siege or subjugation is a multi-turn process wherein a besieging or subjugating army attempts to accumulate 3 siege points against the Walled City or Tribe. Record accumulated siege points with the siege/subjugation markers. A siege point is gained when an activated army rolls well on the Siege/Subjugation Table. Any activated general which ends its move at an enemy Walled City or Tribe space containing at least three friendly CUs (already there or brought along) may conduct one siege or subjugation attempt (one die roll) against that site. A non-activated army on top of a Walled City or Tribe is considered maintaining the siege but may not make a siege or subjugation die roll. No Tribe or Walled City may be subjected to more than one siege or subjugation attempt per strategy card played (i.e., a Major Campaign may not be used to direct three siege attempts against the same city).

<h3 id="20.3">20.3. Subordinates and Sieges/Subjugation</h3>
<p>In the first edition players would detach a subordinate with 3 CUs from a besieging army and move it out and then right back in, allowing the player to make a siege attempt without activating the commanding general. This rule is now acknowledged as legal, and furthermore the subordinate no longer has to exit the space to conduct the siege or subjugation. Simply announce the subordinate is conducting the siege or subjugation. A subordinate conducting a siege or subjugation is considered temporarily in command and may use his special ability. If this occurs during the play of a campaign card, only 3 CUs (or 5 CUs for a Consul) plus the activated subordinate are considered to have been moved. The remaining units and generals in the space are available for further operations on the campaign card.
<p class="example">DESIGN NOTE: Unlike a battle, an officer other than the commanding general often conducted the siege or subjugation.

<h3 id="20.4">20.4. Siege Status</h3>
<p>A city is not considered Besieged until it is marked with one or more siege points regardless of the number of siege attempts that have been made against it or the number of enemy CUs in the same space.

<h3 id="20.5">20.5. Restrictions on Besieged Forces</h3>
<p>A besieged city may not receive reinforcements and a besieged general may not raise troops <a href="#8.2">[8.2]</a>. A besieged army or general may not leave the city via naval movement nor may an army or general debark directly into a besieged city (it may land outside the city walls). A besieged army may sally forth and initiate battle against the besieging army. If it does, the battle and battle card bonuses are resolved normally.

<h3 id="20.6">20.6. Lifting a Siege or Ending Subjugation</h3>
<p>A siege is lifted or subjugation ended the instant there are no longer any enemy CUs in the space containing the Walled City or Tribe. If this happens, remove any accumulated siege or subjugation points (as appropriate). Reducing the besieging army to below 3 CUs does not raise the siege or end subjugation.

<h3 id="20.7">20.7. Relief Armies and Besieged Forces</h3>
<p>If you send an army to attack an enemy army besieging one of your Walled Cities, you may count the CUs inside the Walled City during the battle. When besieged CUs are added to an attack or a besieged army attacks on its own, it is called a sortie. Battle loses can come from either the relief army or the CUs that sortie at the controlling player&apos;s option. If there is a general inside the city when a sortie occurs, and that general outranks the commanding general of the relief army, the general inside the city is considered in command for the battle. If no sortie occurs, the general inside the city is not used in the battle. Only the CUs and generals that sortie may be retreated back into the walled city.

<h3 id="20.8">20.8. Completing a Siege or Subjugation</h3>
<p>When you accumulate three siege points, flip the Walled City marker to your control and remove the siege points. If there were any enemy CUs inside the besieged Walled City, they are eliminated. When you accumulate three siege points against a Tribe, remove the Tribe Marker and replace it with a friendly PC. Once a Tribe has been subjugated it cannot reenter play. If your opponent regains control of the space, he may only place a friendly PC marker there.

<h3 id="20.9">20.9. Tribes Friendly to Carthage</h3>
<p>The Carthaginian player begins the game with three Tribes friendly to him - the Boians, the Insubrians and the Bruttiums. The Carthaginian player may consider these three Tribes as Friendly PC markers in all respects (including Province control, a space to retreat to, and for isolating Roman PCs). These Tribe markers serve as a place where other Carthaginian PCs may trace to prevent isolation <a href="#19.4">[19.4]</a>, and provide the Carthaginian player with an extra BC if a battle (with or without a Carthaginian general) occurs in the Tribe&apos;s space.

<h2 id="21">21. ATTRITION</h2>

<h3 id="21.1">21.1. When Attrition Occurs</h3>
<p>Attrition can occur for the following reasons:
<ul>
<li>WINTER ATTRITION: During the Winter Attrition Phase, all CUs (with or without generals) in spaces containing an enemy PC marker or a non-friendly Tribe suffer Attrition. Players conducting sieges against a city should be aware that their CUs are in a space with an enemy PC marker and will suffer Winter Attrition if still there at the end of the turn.
<li>MOUNTAIN PASS ATTRITION (Optional): Any time an army crosses a Mountain Pass, that army suffers Attrition. See Attrition Table for die roll modifiers. Second edition modifiers are: Alps = 0, non-Alps = -2.
<p class="example">DESIGNER&apos;S NOTE: While Hannibal had a tough time crossing the Alps, it normally was not a difficult a military operation. Hannibal&apos;s experience can be attributed to bad luck and a probably a traitor for a guide.</i>
<li>EVENTS: When triggered by an Event Card (e.g., Hostile Tribe, Mercenaries Desert, Epidemic, Storm at Sea, and Pestilence).
</ul>

<h3 id="21.2">21.2. Procedure</h3>
<p>The owning player makes a die roll for each applicable occurrence and consults the Attrition Table. The owning player cross- references the size of his force in the space with the die roll to determine the number of CUs eliminated. Generals are never affected by attrition (even if attrition eliminates the last CU accompanying that general).

<h3 id="21.3">21.3. Hostile Tribes</h3>
<p>If attacked by Hostile Tribes (cards #7 &amp; #8) the size of your army does not matter. Use the column on the attrition tabled marked Hostile Tribes.

<h2 class="pb" id="22">22. VICTORY CHECK PHASE</h2>
<p>Players count Political Points to see if one side loses PCs for Political Repercussions.

<h3 id="22.1">22.1. Procedure</h3>
<p>During the Victory Check Phase, players counts the number of politically significant provinces they control. All are politically significant except Gallia Transalpinia, Massilia, Liguria, and the Balearic Islands. You earn one point for each politically significant province that you control. There are 18 possible Political Points.

<h3 id="22.2">22.2. Year End Political Repercussions</h3>
<p>After calculating Political Points, the totals are compared. If one side has less points than the other, then the player in the minority must remove a number of his own non-walled, non tribal PC markers from the map equal to the difference in Political Points.
<p class="example">EXAMPLE: The Roman player has nine Political Points, and the Carthaginian player has seven, therefore the Carthaginian player must remove two of his PC markers from anywhere on the map.

<h3 id="22.3">22.3. Sue for Peace</h3>
<p>If a player does not have enough PC markers to remove due to Political Repercussions, his country sues for peace and the game ends immediately.

<h3 id="22.4">22.4. End of Game</h3>
<p>During the Victory Check Phase of the last turn, the player whose Political Point total is greater wins. If there is a tie the Carthaginian player wins.

<h2 id="23">23. SUDDEN DEATH</h2>
<p>Each player can win a Sudden Death Victory. A Sudden Death Victory ends the game immediately.
<ul>
<li>The Roman wins a Sudden Death Victory if he controls Carthage.
<li>The Carthaginian wins a Sudden Death Victory if he controls Rome. He also wins a Sudden Death Victory if he controls all provinces in Italy except Latium during a Victory Check Phase.
<li>Either player wins a Sudden Death Victory if his opponent sues for peace {<a href="#15.6">[15.6]</a> and <a href="#22.3">[22.3]</a>}.
</ul>

<h2 class="pb" id="24">24. SPECIAL ABILITIES</h2>
<p>RULE: Each general has a special ability as indicated below his Holding Box. A general&apos;s special ability can only be used when he is a commanding general. Most special abilities are self explanatory but the following generals require further clarifications:
<p>HANNO: Hanno may not leave Africa, but he may sail from one African port to another. Hanno may only use his special ability to remove a Roman PC if his army does not engage in battle. Hanno may conduct one or more overruns and still be able to use his special ability.
<p>FABIUS: Fabius may not leave Italy, but may sail from one Italian port to another. If there is not at least one stack of 5 CUs in Italy, then Fabius is placed with any friendly CUs in Italy (doesn&apos;t have to be the largest stack). If there are no CUs in Italy, Fabius is placed in Rome (even if under siege).
<p>MARCELLUS: His ability does not apply to subjugation
<p>SCIPIO AFRICANUS: His ability does not apply to subjugation
<p>NERO: Nero can use his special ability with sea movement allowing his army to move three spaces before or after sea movement (split in any fashion). Alternatively, Nero can move twice by sea in the same turn, using 3 MPs for each move.
<p>GAIUS FLAMINIUS: His special ability does apply to preventing a withdrawal.
<p>LONGUS: His special ability does not apply to preventing a withdraw.
<p>PAULUS: His special ability does not apply to preventing a withdraw.

<h2 class="pb" id="25">25. STRATEGY CARD LIST</h2>

<div class="cardlist">
<p>1. Corsica and Sardinia Revolt
<p>2. Sicilia Revolts
<p>3. Numidia Revolts
<p>4. Celtiberia Revolts
<p>5. Marharbal&apos;s Cavalry: May be played even after you have played your last regular BC.
<p>6. Native Guides: Only generals with Strategy Ratings of 1 or 2 may use this event. This modifier is cumulative with other modifiers for the mountains. So a move across a non-Alps pass would have a &quot;-5&quot; net modifier. If the army crosses two separate mountain passes, the modifier may be used for both.
<p>7 &amp; 8. Hostile Tribes: This card may be played against CUs without a general. May be played versus a moving army, stationary army or stationary CUs.
<p>9. Philip V. of Macedon: When the &quot;Philip V. of Macedon allies with Carthage&quot; event is first played, place a marker on the Carthaginian Naval Modifier Box. The Carthaginian player receives this modifier until the event is played again by the Roman Player. If the Roman can then play the event, the Carthaginian player loses a Strategy Card drawn randomly from his hand and Philip is considered to have declared peace, the modifier is lost and that EC is removed from the Strategy Deck.
<p>10. Macedonian Reinforcements
<p>11. Balearic Slingers
<p>12. African Reinforcements
<p>13. Bruttium Recruits
<p>14. Ligurian Recruits
<p>15. Iberian Recruits
<p>16. Gallic Recruits
<p>17. Surprise Sortie
<p>18. Traitor in Tarentum: Your Army must contain at least 3 CUs to use this card.
<p>19. Senate Dismisses Proconsul
<p>20. Spy in Enemy Camp: The revealed enemy BCs must be displayed face-up and remain open to view throughout the battle. If the &quot;Ally Deserts&quot; event is played in combination with the &quot;Spy in Enemy Camp&quot; event, the player may select one of the visible BCs or randomly draw one of the unrevealed BCs at his option.
<p>21. Mercenaries Desert: Affects only CUs not on or in friendly walled city spaces. It matters not whether the CUs are inside or outside the city; they are immune.
<p>22. Mutin&apos;s Numidians
<p>23. Numidian Ally
<p>24. Sophonisba
<p>25. Capua Sides with Carthage
<p>26. Syracuse Allies with Carthage
<p>27. Hannibal: &quot;I have come into Italy, not to fight Italians, but to fight for the liberty of the Italians against Rome&quot;
<p>28. Hannibal Charms Italy: Hannibal can remove the PC from the space he starts in as long as he burns one of his movement points. This benefit may be used in spaces where Hannibal overruns Roman CUs or where the Roman army avoids battle.
<p>29. Carthaginian Naval Victory
<p>30. Carthaginian Siege Train: The Siege Train has all the characteristics of a Carthaginian CU except it has no effect in a normal Battle. The Siege Train may not cross an Alpine Pass or use Sea Movement. If caught alone in a space by enemy CUs or forced to Retreat, it is removed from play. The Carthaginian Player may play this event as many times as he likes, but he may only have one Siege Train on the map at a time. This unit does not take up space in the army, so a Carthaginian army can move with the siege train plus 10 CUs. If the event is played when the siege train is already in play, the siege train can be moved to a different army.
<p>31. Spanish Allies Desert
<p>32. Numidian Allies Desert: If the player had control of both Numidian provinces, he would lose all four BC bonuses.
<p>33 &amp; 34. Major Campaign
<p>35 &amp; 36 Diplomacy
<p>37 - 40 Minor Campaign
<p>41. Bad Weather: If the Bad Weather card is played during a Naval Movement, the naval portion of the move is cancelled. The embarking force must return to its port and remain there for the balance of the round. This card can only be played against movement, not against interception, retreats, avoid battle, etc. The card must be played before the player conducts any naval combat die rolls or mountain pass attrition. If played against an army crossing a mountain pass or strait, the target army may not cross the mountain pass or strait if it needs to use its 3rd or 4th movement point to do so.
<p>BAD WEATHER AND CAMPAIGN CARDS: If played during an opponent&apos;s Campaign card, it can be used to truncate the move of only one force and must be declared before another force moves as part of that Campaign. Also, the event affects the movement of the general and not the CUs (i.e., if the CUs are moved by two different generals, they can still be moved a total of four spaces).
<p>42. Elephant Fright: With regard to BCs lost, the wording on the card is correct, not the wording on the strategy card list of the 1st edition rule booklet.
<p>43. Two Legions of Slaves Raised
<p>44. Allied Auxiliaries (Apulia)*
<p>45. Allied Auxiliaries (Etruria)*
<p>46. Allied Auxiliaries (Samnium)*
<p>47. Allied Auxiliaries (Lucania)*
<p>48. Allied Auxiliaries (Campania) *
<p>* = These CUs have to be placed with a general in Italy and cannot be placed in Rome if there is no general there.
<p>49. Opposing Fleet Breaks Siege: Cannot be used on Capua.
<p>50. Adriatic Pirates: The card seem to imply that CUs may move without generals - this is misleading. All naval movement requires the presence of a general.
<p>51 &amp; 52. Epidemic &amp; Pestilence: The player playing the card may choose which army will roll for attrition.
<p>53. Tribal Resistance
<p>54. Treachery within City
<p>55. Messenger Intercepted
<p>56. Grain Shortage
<p>57 &amp; 58. Hanno Councels Carthage / Cato Counsels Rome: The restriction on these cards are in effect until the start of the turn after the next reshuffling of the Strategy Deck (triggered by the Reshuffle card or when the Strategy Deck is exhausted). Players should place these cards near the map to remind them that they are in effect. These cards affect movement of CUs and not the placement of reinforcements. Generals without CUs may move in and out of Africa.
<p>59. Ally Deserts: This card can be played before any BCs have been played (both players may observe which card is pulled), or held in the hand to be played in any round of the battle.
<p>60. Storms at Sea: The Roman player may not observe how the Carthaginian fares in Naval Combat before deciding to play the Storm At Sea card - the card must be played before rolling the die for Naval Combat. The card seems to imply that CUs may move without generals, this is misleading--all naval movement requires the presence of a general. The attrition result has no affect on generals and if all CUs are eliminated in a storm at sea, then the general returns by himself to the port of embarkation.
<p>61. Force March (1)
<p>62. Force March (2)
<p>63. Force March (3): A player may use the Force March 3 card to make a naval move in addition to moving that force three spaces overland. This card can be used to move a general by sea twice, each sea move costing the army 3 movement spaces. That general could then pick up and drop off CUs along the way.
<p>64. Truce: No interceptions are allowed during a Truce. No siege attempts are allowed either but players may keep their armies outside the city walls to retain their accumulated siege points. A Truce has no affect on subjugation of green Tribes. No matter how the truce is played the deck is reshuffled at the end of the turn (the reshuffling does not break the Truce). Carthaginian Naval Movement is not affected by Roman Naval Supremacy during a Truce; however, Naval Movement can still be affected by Storms at Sea. If you have friendly units on enemy PC Markers when a Truce starts, your units may remain there. Enemy PC Markers underneath your units may not be converted and CUs on top of enemy PC Markers at the end of the turn still suffer attrition.
</div>

<h3 class="pb" >CARDS WHICH DO NOT BREAK THE TRUCE</h3>
<p>Counter cards (storm at sea, bad weather, etc.) do not end a truce, nor is a truce broken when an event is played that does not occur (e.g. Allied Auxiliaries when there are not generals in Italy to take the CUs). Events that move an army also do not break the Truce.

<h3>CARDS WHICH BREAK THE TRUCE</h3>
<p>REINFORCEMENT CARDS: 5 Auxiliaries, 4 Recruits, African/Macedonian Reinforcements, Balearic Slingers, Mutin&apos;s Numidians, Siege Train, Slaves.
<p>REVOLT CARDS: Sicilia, Corsica/Sardinia, Celtiberia, Numidia, Syracuse, Numidian Ally, Sophonisba, Grain Shortage, and Capua Sides with Carthage.
<p>ATTRITION CARDS: Both Hostile Tribe cards (if the event is used), Pestilence, Epidemic, Mercenaries Desert.
<p>POLITICAL EVENTS: both Diplomacy cards, Philip V of Macedon, &quot;I have come...&quot;, both counsel cards (Cato/Hanno), and Senate Dismisses Proconsul.
<p>SORTIES: Surprise Sortie, Tribal Resistance, Opposing Fleet Breaks Siege.
<p>SPECIAL: Messenger Intercepted, Naval Victory

<h3>Reinforcement Cards and Besieged Walled Cities</h3>
<p>All events that bring reinforcements on to the map (Allied Auxiliaries, etc) are under the same restriction as reinforcements in regards to besieged walled cities.
